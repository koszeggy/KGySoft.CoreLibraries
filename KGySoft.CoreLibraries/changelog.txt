~~~~~~~~~
! v6.0.0:
~~~~~~~~~

+ Assembly changes:
===================
+ Targeting also .NET Core 2.1
+ Targeting also .NET 6.0.

+ KGySoft namespace:
====================
+ LanguageSettings class:
  + New DynamicResourceManagersResXResourcesDir property to be able to control the path of the resources for all
    DynamicResourceManager instances with centralized settings.
  + New EnsureResourcesGenerated, EnsureInvariantResourcesMerged, SavePendingResources and ReleaseAllResources
    methods to provide more control over the centralized DynamicResourceManager instances.

! KGySoft.CoreLibraries namespace:
==================================
! ByteArrayExtensions class:
  ! Encrypt/Decrypt methods without a specified SymmetricAlgorithm use the Aes class instead of RijndaelManaged,
    which has been obsoleted starting with .NET 6. This is a breaking change only if we want to use the Decrypt
    method for the result of Encrypt of a previous version (though as a workaround, you still can explicitly pass
    a RijndaelManaged instance to the Decrypt overloads).
! FastRandom class:
  ! The NextInt64() method used to return any long value. Unfortunately .NET 6.0 also introduced a method with the
    very same name but with a different behavior. To consolidate the behavior starting with this version this method
    returns values greater or equal to zero and less than Int64.MaxValue.
    Use the new SampleInt64 method to generate any long value.
  ! NextInt32 method: To harmonize behavior with NextInt64 it returns a non-negative value less than Int32.MaxValue,
    just like Next(). Use the new SampleInt32 method to generate any int value.
  ! NextUInt64 method: To harmonize behavior with the methods above it now always returns smaller values
    than UInt64.MaxValue. Use (ulong)SampleInt64 method to generate any ulong value.
  ! NextUInt32 method: To harmonize behavior with the methods above it now always returns smaller values
    than UInt32.MaxValue. Use (uint)SampleInt32 method to generate any uint value.
  + New constructor overload from Guid seed
  + New NextInt64(long)/NextInt64(long, long) methods (even below .NET 6.0 where base does not have such methods).
  + New NextSingle method (even below .NET 6.0 where base does not have such method).
  + New SampleInt64 method. It has the same behavior as the NextInt64 used to have before this version.
  + New SampleInt32 method. It has the same behavior as the NextInt32 used to have before this version.
! ObjectExtensions class:
  ! [Try]Convert methods:
    ! When converting to string using round-trip formats for some natively supported types that can be restored by
      an opposite [Try]Convert or by StringExtensions.[Try]Parse without losing precision or information, including
      negative zero value or time zone.
    + Using string as a fallback intermediate step if the registered conversions could not be used.
    + Natively supporting conversion between char and Rune collections in both ways (.NET Core 3.0 and above)
! RandomExtensions class:
  ! To be conform with the new NextInt64 methods appeared in .NET 6, Next[U]Int64, Next[U]Int32, Next[U]Int16 and
    Next[S]Byte methods without minValue/maxValue parameters from now on return only non-negative values,
    and never return the possible maximum value of their type. Use the Sample* methods to return any value.
  + New SampleSByte, SampleByte, SampleInt16, SampleUInt16, SampleInt32, SampleUInt32, SampleInt64 and SampleUInt64
    methods to generate any integer value of their corresponding type.
  + New NextBigInteger and SampleBigInteger methods (.NET Framework 4.0 and above)
  + New NextRune methods (.NET Core 3.0 and above)
  + New NextHalf methods (.NET 5.0 and above)
  + New NextDateOnly and NextTimeOnly methods (.NET 6.0 and above)
  + NextObject methods:
    + Supporting BigInteger, considers GenerateObjectSettings.CollectionsLength (.NET Framework 4.0 and above)
    + Supporting Rune (.NET Core 3.0 and above)
    + Supporting Half (.NET 5.0 and above)
    + Supporting DateOnly and TimeOnly (.NET 6.0 and above)
  * Improving performance
+ ThreadSafeRandom class:
  + New NextInt64 methods (even below .NET 6.0 where base does not have such methods).
  + New NextSingle method (even below .NET 6.0 where base does not have such method).
+ DateTimeExtensions class:
  + New AsLocal method
  + New ToUnixMilliseconds/ToUnixSeconds and FromUnixMilliseconds/FromUnixSeconds methods
+ EnumFormattingOptions enum: New Number option.
+ StringExtensions class:
  + [Try]Parse methods:
    + Natively supporting BigInteger type (.NET Framework 4.0 and above)
    + Natively supporting Rune type (.NET Core 3.0 and above)
    + Natively supporting Half type (.NET 5.0 and above)

* EnumExtensions class:
  * GetFlags<TEnum>(TEnum,bool) method: the bool parameter (onlyDefinedValues) is now optional
* SecureRandom class: improving performance
- Files class:
  - GetExecutingPath method: in .NET Framework it could throw an exception from a partially trusted domain.

* KGySoft.Collections namespace:
================================
+ ArraySection<T> struct:
  + New public UnderlyingArray and Offset properties so it's not needed to obtain the AsArraySegment property
    to access the underlying array.
+ StringKeyedDictionary class:
  + New constructor with (int capacity, bool ignoreCase, bool useRandomizedHash) parameters
  + New constructor with (bool ignoreCase, bool useRandomizedHash) parameters
+ ThreadSafeDictionaryClass:
  + New PreserveMergedKeys property
  + New TrimExcess method
  - Automatic merging could occur even if MergeInterval was negative.
* EnumerableExtensions class:
  * Shuffle methods:
    * Improving performance
    + New overload with Guid seed
  * GetRandomElement methods: Improving performance if source is not a list

! KGySoft.ComponentModel namespace:
===================================
! ValidationResultsCollection
  ! The type of the Errors, Warnings and Infos properties have been changed to ValidationResultsCollection. When
    recompiling existing code, this is a non-breaking change and solves also the incompatibility issue between the
    <=.NET 4.0 vs. other targets used different types (IList<ValidationResult> vs. IReadOnlyList<ValidationResult>).
  + New Empty field
  + New this[string] indexer
  + New Message property that combines all messages in this instance.
  + New TryGetFirstWithHighestSeverity method
+ SortableBindingList class:
  + New public writable and nullable SortDirection property (the non-nullable read-only IBindingList implementation
    is an explicit one and used to be exposed as a protected property)
+ ICommandBinding interface
  + New Error event
+ New CommandBindingErrorContext enum
+ New CommandBindingErrorEventArgs class
+ BinaryTypeConverter: Adding InstanceDescriptor support
+ EncodingConverter:
  + Adding InstanceDescriptor support
  - Supporting null reference

  + Adding InstanceDescriptor support
  + Adding Version support (which is cloning like in .NET Core)
  - Supporting null reference
+ StringSegmentConverter: Adding InstanceDescriptor support
- ValidatingObjectBase class
  - PropertyChanged could be triggered for the ValidationResults property even without any change.
- ValidationResult class:
  - Adding the missing Serializable attribute (ValidationResultsCollection was serializable anyway)

+ KGySoft.Resources namespace:
==============================
+ ResXDataNode class:
  + Supporting BigInteger type natively in non-compatible mode (.NET Framework 4.0 and above)
  + Supporting Rune type natively in non-compatible mode (.NET Core 3.0 and above)
  + Supporting Half type natively in non-compatible mode (.NET 5.0 and above)
  + Supporting DateOnly and TimeOnly types natively in non-compatible mode (.NET 6.0 and above)
+ DynamicResourceManager class:
  + New EnsureResourcesGenerated and EnsureInvariantResourcesMerged methods to be able to (re)generate merged
    resource sets for a specified culture respecting the currently set merging options.
+ ResXResourceManager class:
  + New IgnoreResXParseErrors property
+ HybridResourceManager class:
  + New IgnoreResXParseErrors property
- ResXResourceWriter class:
  - Generate method: Calling Generate without adding any content used to save an empty file. Now the header and the
    root element is generated even without adding any content.

! KGySoft.Serialization.Binary namespace:
=========================================
! BinarySerializer class:
  ! SerializeValueType method: Using direct content serialization instead of the Marshal class for value types
    that contain no references. This means a huge performance improvement but also that the result can be
    incompatible with the previous versions for some value types. As a fallback, marshaling has also been preserved
    so this is a breaking change only when considering the content of the produced byte array by previous versions.
  ! TrySerializeValueType method: It no longer serializes value types that have references. Performance improvement.
  ! DeserializeValueType methods: They might not be able to deserialize the content of the previous versions.
  ! [Try]SerializeValueArray, DeserializeValueArray methods: replacing the 'struct' constraint to 'unmanaged'.
    Performance improvement, fixing possible exception about non-blittable types.
  ! Serialize* methods: 
      ! Starting with this version The BinarySerializationOptions.CompactSerializationOfStructures flag affects
        structs only without any references, which is very fast. Marshaling is used only if the obsolete
        ForcedSerializationValueTypesAsFallback flag is enabled.
      ! The produced stream is not compatible with previous versions.
  + New generic [Try]SerializeValueType and DeserializeValueType overloads. They work only for value types without
    any references.
! BinarySerializationFormatter class:
  ! Serialize* methods:
    ! Starting with this version the BinarySerializationOptions.CompactSerializationOfStructures flag affects
      structs only without any references, which is very fast. Marshaling is used only if the obsolete
      ForcedSerializationValueTypesAsFallback flag is enabled.
    ! Deserializing value types with references from raw data is not allowed in safe mode.
    ! The produced stream is not compatible with previous versions.
  + Supporting the BigInteger type natively (.NET Framework 4.0 and above)
  + Supporting the Rune type natively (.NET Core 3.0 and above)
  + Supporting the Index and Range types natively (.NET Standard 2.1 and above)
  + Supporting the Half type natively (.NET 5.0 and above)
  + Supporting the DateOnly and TimeOnly types natively (.NET 6.0 and above)

! KGySoft.Serialization.Xml namespace:
======================================
! XmlSerializer class:
  ! Serialize* methods: Starting with this version the XmlSerializationOptions.CompactSerializationOfStructures
    flag affects structs only without any references, which is very fast.
  ! Deserializing value types with references from raw data is not allowed in safe mode.
  + Supporting the BigInteger type natively (.NET Framework 4.0 and above)
  + Supporting the Rune type natively (.NET Core 3.0 and above)
  + Supporting the Half type natively (.NET 5.0 and above)
  + Supporting the DateOnly and TimeOnly types natively (.NET 6.0 and above)


~~~~~~~~~
* v5.6.1:
~~~~~~~~~

- KGySoft.Collections namespace:
================================
- ThreadSafeCacheFactory class: When using lock free caches, fixing possible VerificationException
  from partially trusted domains (eg. in .NET Fiddle). Affects .NET Framework only.

* KGySoft.CoreLibraries namespace:
==================================
* ObjectExtensions class:
  + New DeepClone<T>(T, Func<object, object?>?) method: The original DeepClone overload was less and less
    reliable on the newer platforms as it uses binary serialization. This new overload performs a more direct
    cloning and also allows customization or transformation by specifying a delegate.
  * The existing DeepClone<T>(T, bool) method has been made obsolete in non-Framework targets in favor of the
    new overload. But even in .NET Framework this overload is recommended only for remote objects to create a
    local copy.

- KGySoft.Diagnostics namespace:
================================
- PerformanceTestBase<TDelegate, TResult> class:
  - Fixing time-based tests interval on some platforms.

* KGySoft.Serialization.Binary namespace:
=========================================
* BinarySerializationFormatter class:
  * SafeMode now protects against various OutOfMemoryException attacks as well.

* KGySoft.Serialization.Xml namespace:
======================================
* XmlSerializer class:
  * DeserializeSafe and DeserializeContentSafe methods protect against some OutOfMemoryException attacks as well.

! v5.6.0:
~~~~~~~~~

MOST IMPORTANT CHANGES: Safe deserialization support (BinarySerializationFormatter, XmlSerializer, ResXDataNode)

! Assembly changes:
===================
! The module initializer initializes the internal resources so configuring LanguageSettings from a consumer code
  is able to configure the resources even if no actual resource was accessed before.
* Members are annotated for using C# 8.0 nullable references

+ KGySoft namespace:
====================
+ PublicResource class: New publicly available localizable resources.

! KGySoft.Collections namespace:
================================
! ArraySection<T> struct:
  ! The indexer and the GetElementReference method do not allow out-of-range indices anymore, even if the underlying
    array is large enough.
  ! Serialization saves the represented array only instead of the whole underlying array and offset/length.
  - AsArraySegment property returns a default ArraySegment<T> if the underlying array is null.
+ New ThreadSafeDictionary<TKey, TValue> class
+ New ThreadSafeCacheFactory class
+ New ThreadSafeCacheOptionsBase/LockFreeCacheOptions/LockingCacheOptions classes
+ New HashingStrategy enum
* Cache<TKey, TValue> class: balancing out hashing performance

! KGySoft.Collections.ObjectModel namespace:
============================================
! VirtualCollection<T> class:
  ! The protected RemoveItem(int) method was renamed to RemoveItemAt(int) and a new virtual RemoveItem(T) method
    has been introduced.
  * Count property and ContainsItem method have been made virtual, too.
! FastLookupCollection<T> class:
  ! Inconsistency detection has been changed (may not detect the same cases as before) because the internal map is
    simply dropped when it would be too expensive to maintain.
  - Fixing binary deserialization
  * Improving performance, reducing memory consumption
* SortableBindingList<T> class:
  * Improving performance, reducing memory consumption
  * Faster sorted enumerator implementation (from now on it supports also the Reset method)

! KGySoft.CoreLibraries namespace:
==================================
! StringSegment struct:
  ! Split methods use StringSegmentSplitOptions struct in place of the old bool removeEmptyEntries parameter.
    There is a conversion from bool to StringSegmentSplitOptions (marked as obsolete) so the change is breaking
    only if the various overloads were called with named removeEmptyEntries argument or by reflection.
- RandomExtensions class:
  - NextObject methods: Fixing the interpretation of GenerateObjectSettings.ChanceOfNull property for all cases.
- ThreadSafeRandom class:
  - If an instance was created by the factory constructor, then after disposing the Next... members could throw
    a NullReferenceException. Now a disposed instance will throw an ObjectDisposedException instead.
- TypeExtensions class:
  - IsImplementationOfGenericType method: fixing possible infinite loop
+ New DelegateExtensions class.
+ DictionaryExtensions class:
  + New TryAdd, TryUpdate, AddOrUpdate, GetOrAdd and TryRemove methods.
+ New StringSegmentSplitOptions struct: Implicitly compatible with StringSplitOptions enumeration but contains
  the TrimEntries flag on every platform target.

! KGySoft.ComponentModel namespace:
===================================
! BinaryTypeConverter:
  ! ConvertFrom method: using safe mode deserialization to prevent loading assemblies during the conversion.
- FastBindingList<T>:
  - FindCore method: The default implementation could throw an ArgumentNullException if the binding list contained
    a null element.
- SortableBindingList<T>:
  - SetItem/InsertItem methods: Not throwing an ArgumentNullException if the list is sorted by a property and a null
    item is set or inserted
- StringSegmentConverter: Differentiating null and empty segments.

! KGySoft.Diagnostics namespace:
================================
! PerformanceTestBase class:
  ! Default value of CpuAffinity is null. So from now on it must be explicitly set to restrict test execution to a
    single core.
! PerformanceTestBase<TDelegate, TResult> class:
  ! Warming up is time based even if Iterations is greater than 0. This provides more reliable results for low
    iteration counts.
  + New Initialize, TearDown, BeforeCase and AfterCase events.

* KGySoft.Resources namespace:
==============================
+ ResXDataNode class:
  + New GetValueSafe method that ensures that no assemblies are loaded during the deserialization.
* ResXResourceWriter class:
  + New SafeMode property that ensures that no assemblies are loaded when writing ResXDataNode instances
    whose raw data has to be regenerated to create a compatible .resx content.
  * AddResource(string, byte[]) method: allowing null array to be conform with the nullability of the
    IResourceWriter interface.
  * AddMetadata(string, byte[]) method: allowing null array to be conform with AddResource(string, byte[]).

! KGySoft.Serialization.Binary namespace:
=========================================
+ BinarySerializationOptions enum:
  + New SafeMode flag that can ensure that no assemblies are loaded during deserialization when using
    BinarySerializer/BinarySerializationFormatter classes. It also prevents deserializing non-serializable types.
! The AnyObjectSerializerWrapper class has been made obsolete:
  ! As the safety context of the consumer formatter cannot be determined, AnyObjectSerializerWrapper deserialization
    uses safe mode, which denies deserializing non-serializable types. It renders this type useless, though it was
    meant for BinaryFormatter anyway, which is also being obsoleted in upcoming .NET versions. To serialize
    non-serializable types you still can use BinarySerializationFormatter, which now supports SafeMode (see above),
    which should be enabled when deserializing anything from an untrusted source.
+ ForwardedTypesSerializationBinder class:
  + New SafeMode property that can ensure that no assemblies are loaded when resolving types by the fallback logic.
+ WeakAssemblySerializationBinder class:
  + New SafeMode property that can ensure that no assemblies are loaded when resolving types.
+ CustomSerializerSurrogateSelector class:
  + New IsTypeSupported property that can be assigned by a delegate to explicitly tell what types are supported.
  + New SafeMode property that can ensure that non-serializable types are not serialized and deserialized if
    the IsTypeSupported property is null.
+ NameInvariantSurrogateSelector class:
  + New SafeMode property that can ensure that non-serializable types are not serialized and deserialized.

+ KGySoft.Serialization.Xml namespace:
======================================
+ XmlSerializer class:
  + New DeserializeSafe and DeserializeContentSafe methods.


~~~~~~~~~
* v5.5.0:
~~~~~~~~~

+ Assembly changes:
===================
+ Targeting also .NET 5.0.
  KNOWN .NET 5.0 PERFORMANCE REGRESSION: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/44457

* KGySoft.CoreLibraries namespace:
==================================
* EnumerableExtensions class:
  * Improving performance of Shuffle<T>(IEnumerable<T>, Random) method.
* StringSegmentComparer class:
  * When targeting .NET 5.0 or later, then Equals(ReadOnlySpan<char>, ReadOnlySpan<char>) and
    Compare(ReadOnlySpan<char>, ReadOnlySpan<char>) overloads can avoid allocating new strings even for
    cultures other than InvariantCulture and CurrentCulture.


~~~~~~~~~
! v5.4.0:
~~~~~~~~~

! KGySoft.CoreLibraries namespace:
==================================
! ThreadSafeRandom class:
  ! Sequences of a given seed are not the same as in the previous versions
  ! The public constructors have been made obsolete. Use the static members instead.
  ! Implementing IDisposable. Instances created by the non-default constructor and the Create methods should be
    disposed to prevent memory leaks.
  * Improving performance, especially for the static Instance property (it doesn't use locks anymore)
  + New Create method that accepts a delegate to provide a thread-safe wrapper for any Random implementation.
  + New Create method that replaces the seed-specifying constructor
+ New FastRandom class
* RandomExtensions class:
  - NextInt64/NetxUInt64 methods: For wide ranges it was possible to return the maxValue even if upper bound was
    not inclusive
  * NextByte/NextSByte/Next[U]Int* methods: improving performance in several cases
* SafeRandom class:
  * Improving performance

+ KGySoft.ComponentModel namespace:
===================================
+ Command class: New CreateSynchronizedPropertyBinding methods
+ CommandBindingsCollection: New CreateSynchronizedPropertyBinding methods

- KGySoft.Resources namespace:
==============================
- ResXFileRef class: The inner converter does not dispose the memory stream after creating the object from stream,
  which solves some rare issues with resources that need to keep the initializer stream to be kept alive.

! KGySoft.Serialization.Binary namespace:
=========================================
! BinarySerializationFormatter class:
  ! Natively supported serialization of StringBuilder have been changed (produced stream is not compatible with
    previous versions)
  - Natively supported serialization of StringBuilder preserves MaxCapacity
  - In .NET 3.5 fixing a deserialization issue affecting some generic collections with nullable element type.


~~~~~~~~~

  + The same Read/ReadToSeparator/ReadLine methods as are in StringSegmentExtensions
  + ToEnum method
  + RemoveQuoes methods
* StringExtensions class: Improving performance of parser methods, reducing number of allocations.
+ StringSegment struct:
  + New IsNullOrWhiteSpace property
  + New Split overloads with ReadOnlySpan<char> separator (.NET Core 3.0/.NET Standard 2.1 and above)
  + New IndexOf/LastIndexOf/StartsWith/EndsWith overloads with ReadOnlySpan<char> value (.NET Core 3.0/.NET Standard
    2.1 and above)
  + New Trim/TrimStart/TrimEnd overloads to allow specifying characters to trim
+ StringSegmentComparer class:
  + Implements also IComparer<string> and IEqualityComparer<string>
  + Now supports comparison between string and ReadOnlySpan<char> instances as well so it can be used in a
    StringKeyedCollection<TValue> instance as a comparer to lookup entries by string, StringSegment or
    ReadOnlySpan<char> (.NET Core 3.0/.NET Standard 2.1 and above) instances without allocating new strings.

  ReadOnlySpan<char> (.NET Core 3.0/.NET Standard 2.1 and above)


~~~~~~~~~
* v5.2.0:
~~~~~~~~~

+ KGySoft namespace:
====================
+ PublicResources class: New IndexOutOfRange property

+ KGySoft.CoreLibraries namespace:
==================================
+ The StringSegment type has been made public. It offers a sort of string operations without allocating new strings.
  Several new public members were added such as:
  + [Last]IndexOf[Any]
  + Substring
  + Trim[Start/End]
  + Split
  + Conversion and comparison members (numerous Equals/Compare/StartsWith/EndsWith overloads)
  + AsSpan, AsMemory (only in .NET Core 3.0 and .NET Standard 2.1)
+ New StringSegmentComparer class: provides equality and lexical comparers for the StringSegment type
+ New StringSegmentEnumerator struct
+ New StringSegmentExtensions class: provides various reader methods for the StringSegment struct, which behave
  as if they mutated (consume) a StringSegment instance, similarly to a StringReader.
* ObjectExtensions class:
  + New In<T> overload with IEnumerable<T> parameter type.
  - Convert/TryConvert methods: Fixing some edge-cases for type converters and fixed-size collections
+ EnumerableExtensions class: New Join method.
- WaitHandleExtensions: Fixing ambiguity when WaitOneAsync is called without additional parameters.

+ KGySoft.Collections namespace:
================================
+ New ArraySection struct
+ New ArraySectionEnumerator struct
+ New Array2D struct
+ New Array3D struct

+ KGySoft.ComponentModel namespace:
===================================
+ New StringSegmentConverter class
* ObservableObjectBase class performance: AffectsModifiedState is not queried if IsModified is already true.


~~~~~~~~~
* v5.1.1:
~~~~~~~~~

- KGySoft.CoreLibraries namespace:
==================================
- EnumerableExtensions class: Fixing a case in IsNullOrEmpty(IEnumerable) method.
- Files class: Fixing GetRelativePath for non-fully qualified yet rooted paths such as "C:x"

+ KGySoft.ComponentModel namespace:
===================================
+ ObservableObjectBase class: New protected IsDisposed property.


~~~~~~~~~
! v5.1.0:
~~~~~~~~~

! KGySoft.CoreLibraries namespace:
==================================
! Files class:
   - GetExecutingPath method: result is fixed for .NET Core 2.0.
   + New CreateWithPath and TryCreateWithPath methods
   ! CanCreate is now obsolete in favor of TryCreateWithPath.

! KGySoft.ComponentModel namespace:
==========================================
! ICommand interface: The Execute method now has a new object parameter argument
+ ICommandBinding interface
  + New WithParameter method
  + The InvokeCommand method has now a new optional object parameter argument
+ New SimpleCommand<TParam>, SourceAwareCommand<TEventArgs, TParam>, TargetedCommand<TTarget, TParam>,
  SourceAwareTargetedCommand<TEventArgs, TTarget, TParam> classes for parameterized commands
+ CommandBindingsCollection: New Add overloads for implicit parameterized commands
! IPersistableObject interface:
  ! TryGetPropertyValue does not throw an InvalidOperationException anymore if CanGetProperty returns false.
    In such case TryGetPropertyValue returns false.
  + New CanGetProperty and CanSetProperty methods: they expose the protected ObservableObjectBase.CanGetProperty and
    CanSetProperty methods via the PersistableObjectBase implementation
+ ObservableObjectBase and its derived types in Core Libraries are now serializable
! ObservableObjectBase
  ! The inner storage is cleared on disposing. Most members will throw an ObjectDisposedException afterwards.
    If the Dispose(bool) method is overridden, then after calling the base implementation observed properties will
    not be accessible anymore.
  * Improving performance of Get/Set methods
  - CanGetProperty and CanSetProperty methods:
    - The default implementations recognize also private properties of base classes (they can use Get/Set methods).
    - If a class had overloaded indexers, then an exception was thrown. Now the type of the firstly defined indexer
      of the most derived class is considered. If the indexers with different return types are set by the Set
      method, then you need to override the CanSetProperty method.
    - If a derived class had non-overridden properties of the same name as the base class, then an exception was
      thrown. Now the most derived property is considered. If you want to set a property of the same name but
      different type in the base class you need to override the CanSetProperty method.
- PersistableObjectBase: Fixing TryReplaceProperty if originalValue is MissingProperty
+ ValidatingObjectBase: The Validate method has been made public. Not needed if changing validated properties
  trigger the PropertyChanged property.
* Commands class:
  * ICommandBinding.AddSource now supports also non-public events
  - Command.CreatePropertyBinding (and CommandBindingsCollection.AddPropertyBinding) works also for simple target
    properties on IPersistableObjectBase targets.
+ CommandState class: Implements IReadOnlyDictionary<string, object> in .NET 4.5 and above

! KGySoft.Diagnostics namespace:
================================
+ ITestCaseResult interface: new Error property. Will be set if a test case throws an exception
! PerformanceTestBase<TDelegate, TResult> class:
  ! DoTest method: If a test case throws a non-critical exception, then it will be caught. The exception is returned
    by the ITestCaseResult.Error property and is dumped by the IPerformanceTestResultCollection.DumpResults method.

+ KGySoft.Reflection namespace:
===============================
+ Reflector class: making the EmptyArray<T> method public.

! KGySoft.Serialization.Binary namespace:
==========================================
! BinarySerializationFormatter class:
  - Allowing an IObjectReference to return null if there are no circular references to itself.
  ! Serialization stream has been changed for non-natively supported object graphs (the stream is not compatible
    with previous versions)


~~~~~~~~~
- v5.0.1:
~~~~~~~~~

- KGySoft.CoreLibraries namespace:
==================================
- Enum<TEnum> class: An exception could come from IsDefined(long/ulong) and GetName(long/ulong) methods if
  if no other members were called previously with the same enum type.
 

~~~~~~~~~
! v5.0.0:
~~~~~~~~~

+ Assembly changes:
===================
+ Targeting also .NET Framework 4.7.2.
+ Targeting also .NET Core 2.0.
+ Targeting also .NET Core 3.0.
+ Targeting also .NET Standard 2.0 (some Reflection APIs throw PlatformNotSupportedException - see the documentation).
+ Targeting also .NET Standard 2.1.

! KGySoft namespace:
====================
! PublicResources Class:
  ! ICollectionNongenericValueTypeInvalid method has been renamed to ICollectionNonGenericValueTypeInvalid
  ! IDictionaryNongenericKeyTypeInvalid method has been renamed to IDictionaryNonGenericKeyTypeInvalid

! KGySoft.Collections namespace:
================================
! Cache<TKey, TValue> class:
  + New constructor for initializing from IDictionary<TKey, TValue>
  ! The non-generic IDictionary.this[object] indexer returns null instead of throwing an ArgumentException if type
    of the indexer argument is not compatible with TKey (this is how Dictionary<TKey, TValue> also works).
! CircularSortedList<TKey, TValue> class:
  ! The non-generic IDictionary.this[object] indexer returns null instead of throwing an ArgumentException if type
    of the indexer argument is not compatible with TKey (this is how SortedList<TKey, TValue> also works).

! KGySoft.CoreLibraries namespace:
==================================
+ New TypeNameKind enum: For the TypeExtensions.GetName method.
! DictionaryExtensions class:
  ! GetValueOrDefault<TKey, TValue, TActualValue>: Caused a functional conflict in .NET Core so this method has been
    renamed to GetActualValueOrDefault. For compatibility reasons the overload for string-object dictionaries
	has not been renamed.
  + In .NET 3.5, 4.0 and 4.5 a new GetValueOrDefault<TKey, TValue> overload has been added with the same functionality
    as .NET Core has. Actually this functionality was provided by the old GetValueOrDefault<TKey, TValue, TActualValue>
	overload when TValue and TActualValue were the same.
  + New GetValueOrDefault overloads for IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<TKey, Tvalue>> instances to support also read-only
    dictionaries. The parameter type is not IReadOnlyDictionary<TKey, TValue> because that would cause ambiguity due
	to the interface inheritance of .NET. In case of non-dictionary instances a sequential search is performed.
  + New GetValueOrDefault overloads with Func<TValue> default value factory. These are useful if the default value
    should be evaluated only if the key does not exist in the dictionary.
+ Enum<TEnum> class:
  + New GetFlagsMask method: Similar to GetFlags methods but returns all flags in a single value.
  + New GetFlagsCount methods.
  + New ToString overload (only for performance optimization, there is no any feature change).
  * Reducing heap usage and improving performance in all platform targets.
- EnumerableExtensions class: Fixing non-generic TryAddRange/TryInsertRange/TryRemoveRange/TryReplaceRange if they
  are called multiple times with generic collections of different generic argument types.
+ ObjectExtensions class:
  + The DeepClone<T> method now has an optional ignoreCustomSerialization parameter, which allows cloning even if
    the ISerializable members throw exceptions (eg. PlatformNotSupportedException in .NET Core).
  + New In overload with ReadOnlySpan (only in .NET Core 3.0 and .NET Standard 2.1)
+ RandomExtensions class:
  + New NextString overloads
  + New NextChars methods to fill up or return a char buffer instead of returning a string instance
  * Reducing heap usage and improving performance in all platform targets.
+ EnumExtensions class:
  + New GetFlagsCount method
! TypeExtensions class:
  ! IsGenericTypeOf method returns false if the type to check is not a constructed generic type (it returned true
    if the type and genericTypeDefinition parameters were the same generic type definition instance).
  + New GetName extension methods for formatting type names in a more consistent way than Type members.
+ Range<T> struct:
  + New Deconstruct method.
  + New operators for converting from T, (T, T). Not available in .NET 3.5, .NET 4.0 and .NET 4.5 versions.
+ ThreadSafeRandom class:
  + New NextBytes overload for Span<char> (only in .NET Core 3.0 and .NET Standard 2.1)

- KGySoft.Diagnostics namespace:
================================
- Profiler: Handling possible SecurityException from a partially trusted domain when determining executing directory.

! KGySoft.Reflection namespace:
===============================
+ New types:
  + ResolveAssemblyOptions enum
  + New ResolveTypeOptions enum
! Reflector class:
  ! ResolveAssembly(string,bool,bool) method:
    ! This method is now obsolete in favor of the new overloads.
    ! Earlier the method returned null if the assembly could not be resolved and tryToLoad was false, and
      threw an exception on load errors. From now on this overload returns always null if the assembly
      cannot be resolved. Use the other overloads with ResolveAssemblyOptions.ThrowError flag to throw a
      ReflectionException on resolve errors.
  + New ResolveAssembly(string,ResolveAssemblyOptions) method
  + New ResolveAssembly(AssemblyName,ResolveAssemblyOptions) method
  ! ResolveType(string,bool,bool) method:
    ! This method is now obsolete in favor of the new overloads.
    ! The bool parameters have been renamed to reflect the current behavior better. The default values have
      been adjusted to provide a better compatibility with the former behavior.
    ! Earlier the method could return null or throw an exception depending on the nature of the resolving error.
      From now on the result is always null if the type cannot be resolved. Use the other overloads with
      ResolveTypeOptions.ThrowError flag to throw a ReflectionException on resolving errors.
  ! ResolveType(Assembly,string) method:
    + A new optional ResolveTypeOptions parameter have been added.
    ! Earlier the method could return null or throw an exception depending on the nature of the resolving error.
      From now on if the type cannot be resolved the result is always null if the options parameter does not contain
      the ResolveTypeOptions.ThrowError flag (default behavior), or throws a ReflectionException if the options
      parameter contains the ResolveTypeOptions.ThrowError flag.
  + New ResolveType(string,ResolveTypeOptions) method. New main features:
    + It can be controlled whether an exception should be thrown if type cannot be resolved.
    + It can be controlled whether to use case insensitive resolving.
    + Generic parameters and open constructed generics are supported if they were dumped by TypeExtensions.GetName.
    + More consistent behavior for partial assembly matching.
  - [Try]InvokeMethod overloads by method name: Considering the methods also in the object class.

* KGySoft.Resources namespace:
==============================
- ResXResourceManager: Handling possible SecurityException from a partially trusted domain when determining
  executing directory.
+ ResXResourceReader/ResXResourceWriter: Supporting every RuntimeType instance natively.

+ KGySoft.Security.Cryptography namespace
=========================================
+ SecureRandom class:
  + New NextBytes overload for Span<char> (only in .NET Core 3.0 and .NET Standard 2.1)

! KGySoft.Serialization namespace:
==================================
! Has been split to KGySoft.Serialization.Binary and KGySoft.Serialization.Xml namespaces.

! KGySoft.Serialization.Binary namespace:
=========================================
+ New types:
  + CustomSerializerSurrogateSelector class: Makes possible to customize the serialization and deserialization
    process both with the original BinaryFormatter and KGy SOFT BinarySerializationFormatter. Can be useful for
    serializing non-serializable types or deserializing changed types even across different platforms, eg.
    .NET Framework and .NET Core.
  + ISerializationBinder interface: Contains the same members as the SerializationBinder class in .NET 4.0 and
    later and allows for BinarySerializationFormatter to use the BindToName method in .NET 3.5 as well.
  + ForwardedTypesSerializationBinder class: Allows to define mappings for legacy assembly identities as well as
    using writing the legacy identity of a forwarded type. This makes possible to use the .NET Framework assembly
    identities even in .NET Core and .NET Standard, for example.
  + CustomSerializationBinder class: Provides delegate callback properties to customize Type-name binding.
  + SerializationInfoExtensions class: Extension methods for manipulating a SerializationInfo instance.
  + ISerializationBinder interface.
  + SerializingEventArgs class.
  + DeserializingEventArgs class.
  + GettingFieldEventArgs class.
  + SettingFieldEventArgs class.
  + ObjectDataObtainedEventArgs class.
  + ObjectDataRestoredEventArgs class.
! BinarySerializationFormatter:
  ! The serialized stream is more compact than before (also meaning, not compatible with previous versions)
  ! The SerializationBinder that is set in the Binder property is not called for constructed generic types and
    natively supported types anymore. Instead, it is called for the generic type definition and the element types
    separately. To call the binder for supported non-primitive types the ForceRecursiveSerializationOfSupportedTypes
    flag can be enabled in the options.
  + Supporting runtime types natively. It was required for .NET Core/Standard that cannot serialize Type instances.
  + Supporting serialization of pointer fields.
  + Supporting ISerializationSurrogate instances, which replace the deserialized object as long as they do not
    prevent resolving circular references.
  ! Considering the TypeForwardedFromAttribute attributes of types on serialization, unless the
    IgnoreTypeForwardedFromAttribute flag is enabled.
  * Improving performance.
  - Some edge case issues have been fixed:
    - If different custom serialized types set the same type by string in SerializationInfo using different names,
      which were resolved to the same type, then the deserialization failed.
    - If non-sealed nested collections were serialized where the base type of an inner collection was a natively
      supported one, and an inner collection element had a derived collection type, then the actual collection type
      was ignored and the deserialized inner collection had the base element type.
    - Resolvable circular references to IObjectReference instances were not handled for natively supported collection
      elements.
! IBinarySerializable interface:
  ! The options parameter of the special constructor and the Deserialize methods get the options of the
    deserialization rather than the original one used for the serialization. If that info is needed you need to save
    it into the custom serialized data.
+ AnyObjectSerializerWrapper class:
  + New optional forceSerializationByFields parameter in constructor.
+ BinarySerializationOptions:
  + New ForceRecursiveSerializationOfSupportedTypes flag.
  + New IgnoreTypeForwardedFromAttribute flag.
+ BinarySerializer: Adding optional BinarySerializationOptions parameter to deserialization methods.
* WeakAssemblySerializationBinder:
  + Implements ISerializationBinder.
  + The OmitAssemblyNameOnSerialize property is available also in .NET 3.5. A BinaryFormatter still ignores this
    property in .NET 3.5 (though it does not affect functionality) but BinarySerializationFormatter is now able
    to use that in all .NET versions.
  + New IgnoreAssemblyNameOnResolve property: If assembly information is available on deserialization but the
    type cannot be resolved from that assembly, then this property allows to resolve the type from any loaded
    assemblies if possible.

! KGySoft.Serialization.Xml namespace:
======================================
! XmlSerializer:
  - Fixing array type names when XmlSerializationOptions.FullyQualifiedNames is set.
  + Supporting every RuntimeType instance natively.
  ! Considering the TypeForwardedFromAttribute attributes of types on serialization, unless the
    IgnoreTypeForwardedFromAttribute flag is enabled.
+ XmlSerializationOptions:
  + New IgnoreTypeForwardedFromAttribute flag.

    to the wrapped collection when they are accessed.
  - Fixing consistency check in SetItem
! SortableBindingList<T>:
  ! SetItem: Invoking ListChange event with ListChangedType.ItemChanged even if setting the same instance again (compatibility with BindingList<T>).

+ IExpandoResourceManager:
  + New CloneValues property
  + New GetStream method
! ResXResourceManager:
  + New CloneValues property
  ! To be compatible with ResourceManager the default value of CloneValues is true, so Get[Meta]Object and Get[Meta]Enumerator will return a copy
    of the stored objects by default. For compatibility with earlier behavior set CloneValues to false.
  ! New GetStream methods: Since in the base ResourceManager these methods are not overridable these are newly defined methods.
    Unlike the base methods, these have MemoryStream return type (instead of UnmanagedMemoryStream).
! HybridResourceManager:
  ! If SafeMode is true the GetString methods do not throw an InvalidOperationException even if the result is from a compiled resource.
  + New CloneValues property
  ! To be compatible with ResourceManager the default value of CloneValues is true, so Get[Meta]Object and Get[Meta]Enumerator will return a copy
    of the stored objects by default. For compatibility with earlier behavior set CloneValues to false.
  ! New GetStream methods: Since in the base ResourceManager these methods are not overridable these are newly defined methods.

    * None option allows to serialize some trusted collection types and object with only public properties and fields.
    + New flag: ExcludeFields - to serialize public properties only.
    + New flag: ForcedSerializationOfReadOnlyMembersAndCollections - to serialize read-only properties and fields even if they are not
      mutable collections or IXmlSerializable instances. Enabling this flag can be used for one-way serialization only (eg. for logs),
      because it is high likely that the object will not be able to be deserialized.
